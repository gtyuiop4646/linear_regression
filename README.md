## Red Wine Quality Regression
Red wine quality is influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from subjective to chemical, making it an interesting subject of study in consumer research. The following analysis focuses on the Red Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009), originally compiled by Cortez et al. (2009) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377).

The dataset contains physicochemical properties (such as pH, fixed acidity, valatile acidity and density), levels of various naturally occuring compounds (such as citric acid, alcohol etc.) and subjective rating of 1599 red wines. The goal of this study is not to predict wine quality, but to develop an explanatory statistical model to identify which variables have the most significant impact on perceived wine quality. The model's performance will be evaluated on a hold-out test set and the potential improvements will be discussed.
